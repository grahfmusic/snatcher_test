# Lighting Editor Test Results

## ‚úÖ **Fixed and Working:**

### **Gizmo Dragging** ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY
- **Evidence:** Multiple successful drag operations in debug log:
  - `Moving light spot_21309 to raw position: 541.0, 344.0`
  - `Grid snap: (541.0, 344.0) -> (544, 352)`  
  - `Updated light spot_21309 position to: 544.0, 352.0`
- **Status:** Gizmo dragging works with proper grid snapping and visual updates

### **Light Creation** ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Evidence:** Created multiple light types successfully
- **Status:** Point, Spot, and Area lights all create correctly

### **Grid Snapping** ‚úÖ WORKING  
- **Evidence:** Consistent grid snapping in all drag operations
- **Status:** 32px grid snapping works perfectly

## üîß **Still Need Testing:**

### **F1/F2 Keyboard Shortcuts** ‚ùì NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION
- **Fix Applied:** Moved F1/F2 key definitions before blocking keys
- **Status:** Need to test manually in game
- **Expected:** F1 should toggle Help panel, F2 should toggle Properties panel

### **Gizmo Selection** ‚ùì NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION  
- **Fix Applied:** Added `clicked` action to drag elements
- **Status:** Need to verify clicking gizmo selects the light
- **Expected:** Clicking gizmo should select light and change its color

## üìù **Summary of Fixes Applied:**

1. **Keyboard Shortcut Functions:** Created dedicated `toggle_help_panel()` and `toggle_properties_panel()` functions with debug output
2. **Gizmo Visual Consistency:** 
   - All lights now show gizmos (not just selected ones)
   - Consistent color scheme: Gold border for selected, cyan for unselected
   - Two-layer gizmo design (border + inner handle) for better visibility
3. **Gizmo Visual Updates:** Added `renpy.restart_interaction()` to refresh screen during dragging  
4. **Drag Position Fix:** Corrected drag offset calculation (12px for 24px handle)
5. **Gizmo Selection:** Added `clicked` action to drag elements for better selection
6. **Radius Indicators:** Now show for ALL lights, not just selected ones
7. **Label Colors:** Use border colors for better text visibility

## üéØ **Next Steps:**
1. Test F1/F2 shortcuts manually (should work now with priority fix)  
2. Verify gizmo click selection works correctly
3. Confirm all visual elements update properly during interaction

The lighting editor is now significantly improved with working drag functionality!
